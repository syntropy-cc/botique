# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made for this system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:
- Understand why certain decisions were made
- Track architectural evolution over time
- Share knowledge across the team
- Avoid revisiting already-decided questions

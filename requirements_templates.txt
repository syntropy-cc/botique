# Dependencies for Template Selector with semantic analysis
# 
# To install: pip install -r requirements_templates.txt
#
# These dependencies are required for the template selection system
# that uses embeddings for real semantic analysis.

# Main library for semantic embeddings
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Required dependencies for sentence-transformers (usually installed automatically)
torch>=1.9.0
transformers>=4.20.0
numpy>=1.19.0

# Optional: For performance optimization
# sentencepiece>=0.1.96  # For specific models
# faiss-cpu>=1.7.0       # For fast vector search in large collections

# NOTE: The system has automatic fallback if sentence-transformers is not available.
# In that case, it uses keyword matching (previous method).
